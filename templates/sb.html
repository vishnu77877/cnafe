    <h2 style="text-align: left; color:lightgreen">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Sheath blight is a fungal disease caused by Rhizoctonia solani. Infected leaves senesce or dry out and die more rapidly, young tillers can also be destroyed.

As a result, the leaf area of the canopy can significantly be reduced by the disease. This reduction in leaf area, along with the diseased-induced senescence of leaves and young infected tillers are the primary causes of yield reduction.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: left; color:lightgreen">Symptoms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Oval or ellipsoidal greenish gray lesions, usually 1-3 cm long, on the leaf sheath, initially just above the soil or water level in the case of conventionally flooded rice.</li>
        <li>Under favorable conditions, these initial lesions multiply and expand to the upper part of the sheaths, the leaves, and then spread to neighboring tillers belonging to different hills (transplanted rice) or plants (direct-seeded rice).</li>
        <li>Lesions on the leaves usually have irregular lesions, often with gray-white centers and brown margins as they grow older.</li>
        <li>In subtropical environments, the disease is mostly initiated by sclerotia (up to two million of which can be produced per square meter in a diseased crop).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="text-align: left; color:red">Control Measures and Nutrient recommendation</h2>
    <ul >
        <li>Use a reasonable level of fertilizer adapted to the cropping season.</li>
        <li>Use reasoned density of crop establishment (direct seeding or transplanting).</li>
        <li>Carefully control of weeds, especially on the levees.</li>
        <li>Drain rice fields relatively early in the cropping season to reduce sheath blight epidemics.</li>
        <li>Use fungicide to treat seeds.</li>
        <li>Improve canopy architecture by reducing seeding rate or providing wider plant spacing.</li>

    </ul>
